<h1>Terms of Service</h1>

<p>Chalo.io ("we"), operate the website located at <a href="http://www.chalo.io">http://www.chalo.io</a> (the "Site"), and provides services offered through the Site and related mobile applications (collectively, the "Services"). The Services are hosted in the United States. This Terms of Use Agreement, as may be modified from time to time ("Agreement"), constitutes legally binding terms and applies to your use of the Services. By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, whether you are a "Visitor" (which means that you simply browse the Services, including, without limitation, through a mobile or other wireless device, or otherwise use the Services without being registered) or you are a "Member" (which means that you have registered with the Site). The term "User" refers to a Visitor or a Member. You are authorized to use the Services (regardless of whether your access or use is intended) only if you agree to abide by all applicable laws, rules and regulations ("Applicable Law") and the terms of this Agreement. In addition, in consideration for becoming a Member and/or making use of the Services, you must indicate your acceptance of this Agreement during the registration process. Your use of, or participation in, certain Services may be subject to additional terms, and such terms will be either listed in this Agreement or will be presented to you for your acceptance when you sign up to use such Services.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to modify this Agreement at any time and from time to time, and each such modification shall be effective upon posting on the Services. All material modifications will apply prospectively only. Your continued use of the Services following any such modification constitutes your agreement to be bound by and your acceptance of the Agreement as so modified. It is therefore important that you review this Agreement regularly. If you do not agree to be bound by this Agreement and to abide by all Applicable Law, you must discontinue use of the Services immediately.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Eligibility. Use of the Services and registration to be a Member for the Services ("Membership") is void where prohibited. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that (a) all registration information you submit is truthful and accurate; (b) you will maintain the accuracy of such information; (c) you are 13 years of age or older; and (d) your use of the Services does not violate any Applicable Law.</p></li>
<li><p>Term. This Agreement, and any posted revision to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect while you use the Services or are a Member.

By choosing to terminate your Membership, you acknowledge and expressly agree that all of your profile content, photos and other information may be irrevocably deleted. Chalo.io may terminate your Membership at any time, for any or no reason, with or without prior notice or explanation, and without liability. Furthermore, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to reject, refuse to post or remove any posting (including, without limitation, private messages between you and other Users), or to deny, restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to all or any part of the Services at any time, for any or no reason, with or without prior notice or explanation, and without liability.
